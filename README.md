# overqwil

An example of an over killed customization of [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/).
inspired by the amazing [codepen](https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/PoGbxLp)
from [Jhey Tompkins](https://github.com/jh3y).

The project is aimed to be consumed as a NPM package if you like the styles
or as a Git template to create your own Mantine UI based components library.
